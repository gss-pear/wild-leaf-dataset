# wild-leaf-dataset

Training a wild pear leaves recognition and classification model requires inputting a large number of pear leaves images as sample images into the network model. Model accuracy and efficiency are significantly influenced by the quality of the dataset used for training. We selected 30 wild Ussurian Pear accessions as the research objects for wild pear leaves recognition and classification, and constructed a natural background wild Ussurian Pear leaves images dataset. We went to the “National Pear and Apple Germplasm Resources Repository (Xingcheng)” to collect images of wild Ussurian Pear leaves. From October 5th to 12th, 2024, use a high-resolution camera on the same mobile phone to capture images of leaves from 30 wild pear resources under natural conditions. Place the camera at a distance of 20-60cm from the leaves, take frontal images of adult leaves, and try to ensure that the leaf shape, leaf bases, leaf apex, and leaf margin in the image are clear as much as possible. Collect 500-600 images for each variety. The collected images are in JPG format with a resolution of 3072 pixels × 4096 pixels. The weather conditions during the shooting process include sunny, cloudy, and rainy days. There are both shooting under soft lighting and strong afternoon lighting, covering various common weather conditions and natural lighting conditions, increasing the diversity and complexity of the natural conditions in which the leaves are located. Ultimately, a total of 16997 images of wild Ussurian Pear leaves were obtained through this process.

The pear leaf dataset was randomly divided into training set, validation set, and testing set in the ratio of 7:2:1 for training, validation, and prediction processes, respec-tively. The image data was manually labeled using the LabelImg tool.

The wild-leaf-dataset is composed of the "images" folder containing leaf images and the "labels" folder containing label files corresponding to leaf images.
